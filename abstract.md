Neurons are the basic cellular components of our brains, which are responsible for processing of the incoming sensory information and generating motor outputs. To fulfill this function neurons connect into large networks through the extensive trees of projections from their cell body called dendrites and axons (two-dimensional projection of a sample neuron reconstructed from microscope images is shown in the figure). The information is encoded and transmitted in neurons by means of electric signals called action potentials. Action potential is a brief change in the negative electric potential that is normally maintained across cell. This change is possible due to flow of charged ions through the neuronal membrane, which creates an electric current (the intensity of the current is color-coded in the figure). The action potential initiates at axon initial segment (inset (a), dark red), where the current of highest intensity is generated. Then it propagates back into the dendritic tree (projections around the soma and going to the top of the figure), where it interacts with the inputs arriving from other neurons, and it is transmitted to the other neurons via the axon (short segment at the bottom of the figure). To increase the speed of action potential propagation, the electric activity in the axon propagates discontinuously by means of nodes Ranvier, where the current briefly increases regenerating the action potential (inset (b), dark red). These trans-membrane currents induce current flow outside the neuron and produce measurable electric potential, which allows to study the electric activity of neurons. The value of the electric potential depends on the distance from the neuron and it is maximum around the site of action potential initiation (white contour lines).
